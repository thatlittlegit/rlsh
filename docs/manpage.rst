rlsh manual page
================


Synopsis
------
rlsh

Description
------
rlsh is a shell meant for ease of use and development. rlsh is written in Java
to provide easier development, and has classic features from :manpage:`bash(1)`
and :manpage:`sh(1)` compatable shells to make usage easier. Plugins will be
able to be written in JavaScript for ease and features.

Currently, rlsh is in beta-alpha-testing-dev stage, which means that it's very
broken. Luckily, it is being built on a strong development model for object-orientedness

Note
------
This manpage will describe basic syntax of rlsh; if you want a manual, see the
:manpage:`info(1)` page.
